Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table =10000 
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table =10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table =10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category =2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute =1115 (business_id)
v. Review =10000(id) 8090(business_id) 9581(user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493(business_id)
vii. Photo =10000 (id) 6493(business_id)
viii. Tip = 3979(business_id) 537(user_id)
ix. User = 10000 (user_id)
x. Friend = 11(id)
xi. Elite_years =2780(user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	The calculation between these two variables of Pearson Correlation Coefficient is positive 0.43, so generally the number of fans increases with the number of reviews

select avg( (review_count - avg_x) * (fans - avg_y) )*avg( (review_count - avg_x) * (fans - avg_y) )/(var_x*var_y) as C

      from user, (select 
          avg(review_count) as avg_x, 
          avg(fans) as avg_y 
          from user)

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

   Yes，The 4-5 star restaurants seems to have shorter hours then the 2-3 star group.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

   Yes, the 4-5 star group has more reviews than the 2-3 star group         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
     
     No, every restaurant is in a location.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 
    B.name,
    B.city,    
    B.postal_code,
    B.review_count,
    CASE
        WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
        WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
    END AS star_rating,
    CASE
        WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
        WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
        WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
        WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
        WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
        WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
        WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
    END AS ord,
    HC.category,
    HC.hours
FROM business B inner JOIN 
(SELECT hours.business_id, hours.hours,category.category
FROM hours inner join category
on hours.business_id=category.business_id
where category like 'Restaurants') HC
ON B.id = HC.business_id
where B.city like 'Las Vegas' and star_rating <>'None '
order by ord, star_rating

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
open: more reviews
close: ess reviews     
         
ii. Difference 2:
open: higher stars
close: lower stars         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT count(id),is_open,avg(review_count),avg(stars)
from business
group by is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   
   Predicting the star rating for Restaurants.    
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    
    There are many variables that can have effects on the star rating of restaurants, including location, review, business hours and attributes.
    In terms of location, we can gather address, city, state, postal_code, latitude, longitude that can indicate the relatively specific location.             
    In regrad of review, we can gather the number of reviews for the restaurant,later we can aslo analyze texts of reviews and reviews's weight like the number of fans.
    As for business hours, we can gather the opening hours on each day in a week.
    At last, each restaurant has varied attributes to show its characteristic, so the inforamtion of attributes could also be important.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
